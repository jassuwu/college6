# Fourier Transforms and Shannon-Hartley Theorem

OFDMA - Shannon-Hartley Theorem - RMS - F proportional to bitrate

OFDMA -> LTE (high speeds) + Hz

At heart of OFDMA lies Fourier Transforms.
QPSK and QAM.
Constellation Diagram. - The phase diagram.

QPSK and QAM are used to transmit data over OFDMA.

When there is interference QPSK, and QAM can transmit over straight line of sight.

QAM - Amplitude and Phase.
QPSK - Phase only.

Sinc wave FDT - Fourier Transform of a Sinc wave.

- The peak of the wave is higher than the average. So we need a highly powerful transmitter to send these waves out. These can't be generated from Mobile phones. So mobile phones can _receive_ these waves but can't _transmit_ them. They can transmit SC-FDMA waves. The key is equaliziation. (Equalization is the process of removing the distortion caused by the channel.?)

This is why LTE has higher bandwidth than the previous generations. It keeps on being used in 5G. So, Fourier Transforms and Shannon-Hartley Theorem are the key.

There are multiple carriers in a single channel for Downlink.
What TDM and FDM is. TDM + the Frequency Syncing is SC-FDMA.
TDM is very inefficient in transmitting high amount of data.
Uplink (SC-FDMA) has high bitrate, Downlink (OFDMA) has slow bitrate.

Combinations of errors we have to deal with and the error correction makes uploads slower than downloads.

The key thing to note is that the waves went from looking like a sin curve to sinc curve, we have higher Hertz in LTE.

5G uses even higher \_\_\_\_.
