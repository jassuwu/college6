# Mobile Computing Definition

Mobile Computing is a technology that allows people to access network services from **any location at any time using portable and wireless communication devices**. This means that with Mobile Computing, people can use their mobile devices to connect to the internet and access various services while on the go.

# Mobility

There are two types of mobility:

- **User Mobility** - This is the ability of a user to move around while using a mobile device. For example, a user can move around while using a mobile phone to make a call.

- **Device Mobility** - This is the ability of a device to move around while connected to a network. For example, a mobile phone can move around while connected to a mobile network.

# Classification of communication devices

- **Fixed and Wired** - These are devices that are connected to a network using a wired connection. For example, a desktop computer connected to a network using an Ethernet cable.

- **Fixed and Wireless** - These are devices that are connected to a network using a wireless connection. For example, a desktop computer connected to a network using a wireless router.

- **Mobile and Wired** - These are devices that are connected to a network using a wired connection but can move around. For example, a laptop computer connected to a network using an Ethernet cable.

- **Mobile and Wireless** - These are devices that are connected to a network using a wireless connection and can move around. For example, a laptop computer connected to a network using a wireless router.

# Wireless Communication – Short History

- Light, flag, smoke signals
- Optical Telegraph, Telephone
- Electro magnetic waves (Maxwell, Michael Faraday, Hertz)
- Radio –short wave , AM and FM
- Television (John Baird)

# Wireless Network Standards

A brief overview of each standard:

- **NMT (Nordic Mobile Telephone System)**: A European analog standard for mobile telephony.
- GSM: Originally an analog standard called Group Speciale for Mobile, now a digital standard called Global System for Mobile Communication operating at 900 MHz.
- **AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System)**: An early analog mobile phone system standard used in North America and other countries.
- **Cordless systems (CT0, CT1, CT2)**: Early standards for short-range cordless telephones.
- **DECT (Digital European Cordless Telephone)**: A digital cordless telephone standard used in Europe and other regions.
- **Wireless LAN Standards (IEEE 802.11, HIPERLAN)**: Standards for wireless local area networks (WLANs) that allow devices to communicate with each other over short distances without cables.
- **Mobile communication using satellites (Global Satellite System)**: A system that uses satellites to provide mobile communication services to users around the world.
- **Current standards (UMTS, IMT 2000)**: UMTS is a 3G standard for GSM networks while IMT 2000 is a set of standards for 3G cellular systems.

# Wireless Network - Definition

A **wireless network** is a technology that enables two or more entities to communicate using electromagnetic waves in open space. This allows for the transmission of data without the need for physical connections such as wires or cables.

# Wireless Network - Advantages

- **Reduces cost**: Wireless networks eliminate the need for expensive wiring and cabling, reducing the overall cost of setting up and maintaining a network.

- **Access computing/communication services on the move**: With wireless networks, users can access computing and communication services even when they are on the move. This allows for greater flexibility and mobility.

- **Shrinks the world**: Wireless networks allow for instant communication and data transfer across vast distances, effectively shrinking the world and making it easier to connect with others.

- **Always connected**: With wireless networks, users can stay connected to the internet and other network services at all times, without having to worry about losing connectivity.

- **Scalable**: Wireless networks can easily be scaled up or down to accommodate changes in user demand. This makes it easier to add new users or devices to a network without having to make significant changes to the underlying infrastructure.

# Challenges in Mobile Computing (Expanded)

Mobile computing faces several challenges.

- **Signal Strength:** The signal strength of wireless networks can fluctuate significantly while on the move. This can lead to a high error rate in data transmission.

- **Shared Channel:** Wireless networks use a shared channel for communication, so their access capacity is limited. This means that as more users connect to the network, the available bandwidth for each user decreases.

- **User Location Management:** As users move around with their mobile devices, it becomes difficult to keep track of their location and provide them with location-based services.

- **Device Limitation:** Mobile devices have limitations that pose challenges for mobile computing. They often have limited memory and computational power compared to desktop computers. Their small displays can make it difficult to view and interact with content. And their battery life is limited, which means they need to be recharged frequently.
