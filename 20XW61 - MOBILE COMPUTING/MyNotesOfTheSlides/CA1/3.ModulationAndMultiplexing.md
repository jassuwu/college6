# Modulation

## Digital and analog modulation.

- Digital modulation translates digital data into an analog signal using techniques such as ASK, FSK, and PSK.
  - These techniques differ in spectral efficiency, power efficiency and robustness.
- Analog modulation shifts the center frequency of the baseband signal up to the radio carrier.
  - This is done for reasons such as smaller antennas and frequency division multiplexing.
  - The basic schemes of analog modulation include amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM) and phase modulation (PM).

## Digital modulation

Three types of digital signal modulation known as Shift Keying:
Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), Phase Shift Keying (PSK) and many advanced variants.

- ASK is simple and has low bandwidth requirements but is susceptible to interference.
- FSK needs larger bandwidth.
- PSK is more complex but robust against interference.

### Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)

- ASK is a simple modulation technique where the amplitude of the carrier is varied to represent the data.
- Two binary values (0 and 1) are represented by two different amplitudes.
- However, in wireless communication, a constant amplitude cannot be guaranteed. As a result, ASK is typically not used in wireless communication.

### Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)

FSK is a form of digital signal modulation.

- The simplest form of FSK is binary FSK, which assigns one frequency (f1) to binary 1 and another frequency (f2) to binary 0.
- A simple way to implement FSK is to switch between two oscillators with frequencies f1 and f2.
- The receiver can demodulate the signal by using two bandpass filters.

### Phase Shift Keying (PSK)

PSK is a form of digital signal modulation.

- Uses shifts in the phase of a signal to represent data.
- Binary PSK is a type of PSK where the phase is shifted by 180 degrees each time the data changes.
- For successful communication using PSK, the receiver must synchronize in frequency and phase with the transmitter.

### Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (Q-PSK)

Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (Q-PSK), a form of digital signal modulation that allows for higher bit rates within the same bandwidth by coding two bits into one phase shift.

- The text provides examples of how different data values are represented by different phase shifts:

  - 45 degrees for data “11”,
  - 135 degrees for data “10”,
  - 225 degrees for data “00”,
  - and 315 degrees for data “01”.

# Multiplexing

- A fundamental mechanism in communication systems and networks that enables multiple users to share a medium.

- In wireless communication, multiplexing can be carried out in four dimensions:
  - space,
  - time,
  - frequency,
  - code.

## Space Division Multiplexing (SDM)

- A method where channels are assigned on the basis of “space” but operate on the same frequency.
- The assignment ensures that transmissions do not interfere with each other by using a guard band in between.

## Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)

- In FDM, the frequency domain is subdivided into several non-overlapping frequency bands.
- Each channel is assigned its own frequency band with guard spaces in between to prevent interference.

## Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)

- TDM is a technique where a channel is allocated the entire bandwidth for a specific duration.
- In this method, all senders transmit their signals using the same frequency but at different times.

## FDM vs TDM

## FDM and TDM

- In some systems, a channel may use a specific frequency for a certain duration and then switch to a different frequency at another time.
- This technique is used in the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM).

## Code Division Multiplexing (CDM)

A technique where channels are separated by assigning each channel its own unique code.

- Guard spaces between channels are created by having distance in code space, such as using orthogonal codes.
- In this method, transmitters can transmit in the same frequency band at the same time but must use different codes. CDM provides good protection against interference and tapping but requires relatively complex receivers.
- The receiver must know the code and be able to separate the channel with user data from noise composed of other transmissions.
- Additionally, the receiver must be synchronized with the transmitter.
