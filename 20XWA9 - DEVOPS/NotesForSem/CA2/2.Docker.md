# Docker

Docker is a platform that allows developers to easily create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight and portable, making it easy to move them between environments.

## Containerization vs Virtualization

Containers are lightweight and portable, making it easy to move them between environments. Docker containers share the host operating system kernel, which makes them more lightweight than virtual machines.

Virtual machines (VMs), on the other hand, virtualize the computer hardware. They allow multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine. Each VM runs its own operating system kernel, which makes them more resource-intensive than Docker containers.

In summary, Docker provides container virtualization while VMs provide hardware-level virtualization. Docker containers are more lightweight than VMs and share the host operating system kernel.

## Key features of Docker

- Fast and efficient development life cycle
- Segregation of duties
- Service-oriented architecture
- Security
- Scalability
- Reduction in size

## Advantages

- Compatibility and Maintainability
- Rapid Deployment
- Continuous deployment and testing environment
- It uses less memory
- Simplicity and Faster Configurations

## Disadvantages

- Lack of GUI
- Command-line operations
- Performance overhead due to overlay networking, interfacing within containers and the host system

Docker architecture consists of a `Docker client`, `Docker daemon`, `Docker images`, `Docker registries`, and `Docker containers`. The client sends commands to the daemon which creates and manages containers. The images are used to create containers. Registries store images that can be used by multiple users. Containers are isolated environments that run applications.

## Key terms from the slides:

- Docker swarm
- Routing mesh
- Services
- Security

## Docker images and containers

Docker images are read-only templates that contain a set of instructions for creating a Docker container. They are used to create Docker containers and can be thought of as a snapshot of a container.

Docker containers are instances of Docker images that can be run as an application or service. They are lightweight and portable, making it easy to move them between environments. Containers are created from images and can be started, stopped, and deleted as needed.
