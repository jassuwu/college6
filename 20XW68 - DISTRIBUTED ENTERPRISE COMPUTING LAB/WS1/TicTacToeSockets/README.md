    Yeah, there's no GUI. Yeah, there's no error checking. Yeah, it's a mess. But it works. Be a good sport and don't cheat. Use the correct inputs at the correct times and you'll be fine.

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
