## Java Singleton Pattern Implementation

### The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

    The eight different ways to implement the Singleton Pattern in Java are:
    1. Eager Initialization
    2. Static Block Initialization
    3. Lazy Initialization
    4. Thread Safe Lazy Initialization
    5. Bill Pugh Singleton Implementation

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `bin`: the folder generated by default to maintain output files

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
